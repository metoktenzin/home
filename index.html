			<h2 id = "What is Chess" class="header">What is Chess</h2>
			<p>Chess is a popular board game that is played on a worldwide scale,
			but is played the most in Russia. It is a competitive game that is played between 
			two players, and requires both strategy and skill. Although this greatly varies, 
			each game usually has an average length of 10-20 minutes. These games are played 
			on a checkerboard and include 32 pieces that are evenly distributed amongst the players.</p>
			
			<h2 id="How the Pieces Work" class="header">How the Pieces Work &#9814; &#9812; &#9816;</h2>
			<p>Although chess pieces may seem intimidating at first, they are really quite simple to learn. 
			Each player is dealt 16 pieces of 6 different types. These include: the king, queen, bishop, rook,
			knight, and pawn. Each of these 6 types of pieces move in their own unique way across the chess board!
			First, is the king. Even though this is the most important piece in the game, it's one of the weakest 
			pieces, as it's movement is very restricted. This proves true, as the king can only move within a one 
			square radius to any direction. The next piece, is the rook. The rook can move in straight lines in any direction, this 
			can be done for any amount of squares. Another piece, is the bishop. This piece moves diagonally in any directions and 
			also doesn&rsquo;t have a limit for the amount of squares that can be moved.  </p>
			
			<h2 id="How to Play" class="header">How to Play</h2>
			<p> In Chess, the main objective is to checkmate the king. Checkmating occurs when the king is cannot escape an attack with any moves. 
			
			<h3 id="Standard Rules" class="header">Standard Rules</h3>
			<p>Like all games, there are rules that should be followed. Firstly, the player with white pieces must always make the first move.
			After they move, each player takes a turn to move one piece each time, and they must only move during their turn. 
			When moving a piece, you must only move your pieces unless you are eliminating one of your opponent's pieces. </p>
			
			<h3 id="Strategies and Tactics" class="header"> Strategies and Tactics</h3>
			<p>There are many different strategies and tactics in chess. </p>
			These are used to improve your skills as well as your chances of winning.
