			<img src ="https://as1.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/01/24/94/220_F_1249442_W6CVWfKz0W2YrAycv5EtCVI6lQMAxc.jpg" width="250" alt="Chessboard">
			<p> Chess is a popular board game that is played on a worldwide scale
			but is played the most in Russia. It originates from India, with its first traces dating back to up to 1500 years ago. 
			Chess is a competitive game that is played between two players and requires both strategy and skill. Although this greatly varies, 
			each game usually has an average length of 10-20 minutes. These games are played 
			on a checkerboard and include 32 pieces that are evenly distributed amongst the players.</p>
			
			<h2 id="How the Pieces Work" class="header">How the Pieces Work &#9814; &#9812; &#9816;</h2>
			<p>Although chess pieces may seem intimidating at first, they are quite simple to learn. 
			Each player is dealt 16 pieces of 6 different types. These include: the king, queen, bishop, rook,
			knight, and pawn. Each of these 6 types of pieces move in their own unique way across the chessboard!
			First, is the king. Even though this is the most important piece in the game, it&rsquo;s one of the weakest 
			pieces, as its movement is very restricted. This proves true, as the king can only move within a one 
			square radius in any direction. 
			
			<p>Second, is the rook. The rook can move in straight lines in any direction, this 
			can be done for any amount of squares. Another piece is the bishop. This piece moves diagonally in any direction and 
			also doesn&rsquo;t have a limit for the number of squares that can be moved. </p>
			
			<p>The next piece is the pawn. The pawn can
			move up to 2 squares in its first move, but can only move 1 square for the remainder of the match. It eliminates other 
			pieces that are diagonally one piece in front of them and can change into any other piece excluding itself and the king 
			if it successfully moves to the end of the other side of the board. The Knight is a very unique piece because, unlike the other pieces, it can
			move over other pieces in an enclosed area. It moves in 3 spots straight and one spot to the left in any direction, forming an L shape. Last, 
			but not least, is the queen, which is a very powerful piece on the board.
			It doesn&rsquo;t have one set movement pattern but instead utilizes both the bishop&rsquo;s and rook&rsquo;s moving pattern.</p>
			
			<h2 id="How to Play" class="header">How to Play</h2>
			<img src="https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/01/51/19/89/1000_F_151198978_bydnhJGfsSObpD55hgxS5Cqa9QOcEUZf.jpg" width="200" alt="Chessboard with pieces getting eliminated">
			<p> In Chess, the main objective is to checkmate your opponent&rsquo;s king. Checkmating occurs when the king is in a position where in the next move 
			the opposing team can eliminate this piece, and it has to try to get in a position where this cannot happen. When you checkmate them and they 
			cannot escape an attack with any moves in their next move, then you win. The easiest way to make this happen is by eliminating as many other pieces as possible. 
			By doing this, you leave a few pieces of your opponent that are able to defend with.</p>
			
			<h3 id="Standard Rules" class="header">Standard Rules</h3>
			<p>Like all games, some rules that should be followed. Firstly, the player with white pieces must always make the first move.
			After they move, each player takes a turn to move one piece each time, and they must only move during their turn. 
			When moving a piece, you must only move your pieces unless you are eliminating one of your opponent's pieces. </p>
			
			<h3 id="Strategies and Tactics" class="header"> Strategies and Tactics</h3>
			<p>There are many different strategies and tactics in chess. These are used to improve your skills as well as your chances of winning. 
			Throughout all the different levels of experience in chess players, these are used everywhere.
			One of the ways to get better is  by practicing your openings. Openings are the first couple of moves you make in each game, and
			they determine what the rest of the game will look like. Some examples of different chess openings are Another part of chess that 
			is also focused on, are the endgames. This is usually more focused on by players of higher skill, as they are a bit more challenging than openings. 
			Some examples of endgames include </p>

			<img src="https://somedudesays.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shatranj.png" width="250" alt="Shatranj">
			<p> Although we normally focus on the original version of chess, other versions are played significantly more depending on the location. 
			For example, one that also originates in India is Shatranj. This is an old form of chess that isn&rsquo;t as popular as it was in its time era, which was roughly in 600 AD. 
			This form of chess is quite similar to the original version, as the only difference was that there were different pieces, but they had relatively similar functions to 
			our now modern chess. It is believed that this came before chess, as there is a lot of evidence to believe so. This is just one of the many kinds of chess,

			All of these players have different levels that distinguish them apart and show their standings.

			<p>In chess, there are different levels depending on your rating. Usually, beginners have lower ratings and more experienced players have higher ratings. 
			These are used to determine who you match with in tournaments and other competitive matches.</p>
